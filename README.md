# Human-Trafficking

Human trafficking is a global phenomenon: more than 130 countries have reported cases. It is one of the most lucrative illegal activities, after drug and arms trafficking.

Human trafficking is condemned as a violation of human rights and I think it is important to give visibility to this social problem.
